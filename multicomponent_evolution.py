"""this python file contains the implementation of the code of the paper
'Evolved interactions stabilize many coexisting phases in multicomponent fluids'

The modules contains a few global constants, which set parameters of the algorithm as
described in the paper. They typically do not need to be changed. A good entry point
into the code might be to create a random interaction matrix and a random initial
composition using `random_interaction_matrix` and `get_uniform_random_composition`,
respectively. The function `evolve_dynamics` can then be used to evolve Eq. 4 in the
paper to its stationary state, whose composition the function returns. The returned
composition matrix can be fed into `count_phases` to obtain the number of distinct
phases. An ensemble average over initial conditions is demonstrated in the function
`estimate_performance`, which also uses Eq. 5 of the paper to estimate how well the
particular interaction matrix obtains a given target number of phases. Finally,
`run_evolution` demonstrates the evolutionary optimization over multiple generations.
